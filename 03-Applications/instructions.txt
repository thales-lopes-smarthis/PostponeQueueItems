For each application involved in the automation, a folder must be created according to the name of the application as follows:

1) Create a folder according to the application name.
E.g.
For SAP Application, the folder must be created as "Sap"

2) Create the necessary workflows based on the "InitializeAppGeneric.xaml" and "CloseOrKillAppGeneric.xaml" templates according to the name of the application.
E.g.
For SAP application, workflows can be created and named as “InitializeSap” and “CloseOrKillSap”, respectively.

3) Change ActivityBuilder name and Sequence name within each workflow to match their new names. 

4) Any other workflow that must be created to interact with an application should be placed in its folder.
